# Bike-Share-Optimization-Platform
## Introduction
The Bike-Share-Optimization-Platform is a web application designed to offer an optimized biking experience for users seeking time-efficient and cost-effective travel routes. Utilizing a combination of a user-friendly map interface and a operation section, the application allows users to select starting points and destinations, intelligently planning the best routes based on two key factors: time cost and spend cost.

By setting a preference using a slider, users can balance their desire to minimize spending with the need for speed, customizing their journey to suit their individual needs. The application employs algorithms including smart pruning and dynamic programming to generate results that approximate the 'ideal skyline results'. The approximate skyline results closely match the actual skyline outcomes, effectively balances optimal routing against the computational challenge of computing all paths in a complete graph, offering a practical solution for users to tailor their journey efficiently.

The platform's core innovation lies in its ability to provide quick, effective, and personalized biking routes, making it an invaluable tool for urban commuters and leisure cyclists alike.
